        <h2>Roy Ben-Shalom</h2>
        <h3>Principal Investigator</h3>
  <img src="https://benshalomlab.com/images/team/roy.png" alt="roy" class="team-img" />
        <p>As an Assistant Professor in Neurology and the MIND Institute at UC Davis and a first-generation immigrant, I lead a lab studying 
            neurodevelopmental conditions, with a focus on channelopathies. We combine patch-clamp electrophysiology, high-density microelectrode array recordings, 
            and computational modeling to understand how mutations in genes associated with NDDs affect neuronal excitability and network dynamics.<br><br>

            Our approach links single-neuron properties to circuit-level disruptions. We use patch-clamp to characterize intrinsic neuronal properties, HD-MEAs to capture 
            network activity, and biophysical models to bridge these scales. This multidisciplinary approach allows us to investigate how alterations in neuronal 
            excitability lead to diverse neurological outcomes.<br><br>

            We aim to advance understanding of how genes shape neuronal networks and behavior, while working towards potential therapies. Our lab is committed to 
            fostering diversity and inclusion, and we’re especially excited to work with students from varied backgrounds. We welcome those interested in combining 
            experimental and computational neuroscience to tackle these complex disorders.<br><br>
