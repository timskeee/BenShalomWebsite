    <h1>Welcome to the Ben-Shalom Lab</h1>
    <p>The goal of the lab is to reverse engineer neuronal activity to better understand and treat Neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, epilepsy, and developmental delays. We utilize computational modeling and electrophysiological techniques to study the mechanisms of neuronal function.</p>
